How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area can have things added to it and you can see the status of it
Working directory is showing directly what you are working on and no cluter of what is being added to a staging area
Repository just shows you what is held within it

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can check --staged to see what you have staged
you can check git diff to see what changes you have made 
You can see if you have more than one logical change at a time 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If you were making changed that were experimental and didnt want to use it on the actual version 
If there were different language versions of the document 
Branches let you easily checkout the differences without having to keep changing the master branch
